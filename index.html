    <div>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer,
        media proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority
       shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of
       Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of 
       the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

       <em><pre><h3>    
        Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth.
        Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year.
        In 1974, he traveled through India seeking 
        enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism.

           Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).
            This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first
             mass-produced computer with a GUI
